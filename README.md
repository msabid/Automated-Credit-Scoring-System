**# Automated-Credit-Scoring-System**


This dataset simulates applicant data for an automated credit scoring system, designed to evaluate the creditworthiness of individuals. It consists of 5,000 records, each representing a unique applicant. The data includes a variety of attributes spanning demographic, financial, credit, transactional, and socioeconomic factors:

**Demographic Information**: Includes age, gender, marital status, and dependents.

**Educational Background:** Captures the highest level of education attained.

**Financial Details:** Contains annual income, employment status, years employed, primary income source, monthly expenses, debt-to-income ratio, and credit score.

**Credit History: Details** the length of credit history, previous defaults, number of credit lines, credit utilization, late payments, and bankruptcies.

**Transaction Behavior:** Encompasses transaction frequency, average transaction amount, and transaction type.

**Socioeconomic Factors:** Includes residential status, location, property ownership, and employment sector.

This synthesized dataset is intended for use in developing and testing machine learning models for credit scoring, offering a rich set of features to explore the dynamics of financial behavior and risk assessment.



**#Analytical Techniques**
This project employs a variety of data preprocessing and machine learning techniques to assess and predict the creditworthiness of applicants based on the dataset:
Data Preprocessing:
•	Handling Missing Values: Missing values are imputed using median for numerical features and a constant placeholder for categorical features.
•	Scaling and Encoding: Numerical features are scaled using RobustScaler to minimize the impact of outliers. Categorical features are one-hot encoded to convert them into a format suitable for machine learning models.
Feature Engineering:
•	Principal Component Analysis (PCA): PCA is used for dimensionality reduction, helping to enhance model training efficiency and reduce noise in the dataset.
Model Evaluation:
•	Cross-validation: Repeated Stratified K-Fold cross-validation is utilized to ensure that each fold is a good representative of the whole.
•	Model Selection: Multiple classification models including K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, RandomForest, and a Voting Classifier are evaluated to determine the best performer.
Model Optimization:
•	Hyperparameter Tuning: GridSearchCV is used for hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
•	Feature Selection: Techniques like SelectFromModel are employed with Logistic Regression to identify the most impactful features.
Metrics:
•	Classification Reports and Confusion Matrices: These provide insights into the precision, recall, F1-score, and overall accuracy of the models, allowing for detailed performance analysis.
This comprehensive analysis framework aids in building robust predictive models, vital for the development of reliable automated credit scoring systems.
